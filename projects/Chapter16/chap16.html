        <p>You are the captain of a spaceship named "The Flying Hippo." One day, you're working on tuning up your ship's engines when you get an urgent message on your space phone:</p>
        <p>"Captain, one of our Mars robots is sick. We need you to go to Mars immediately and retrieve it so that we can fix it and download the results of its important experiments."</p>
        <p>You remember that you're supposed to go to a meeting of the Space Scouts tonight, and you were really looking forward to it. But, on the other hand, the other Space Scouts would understand that this mission is very important.</p>
        <p>What do you do? Go to Mars, or stay home?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer02">
        <p>Answer Yes when you're ready!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="err0">
        <p>Please answer yes or no.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer11">
        <p>Great choice! Mars is lovely this time of year (or, during the time of the year when you'll arrive, about 260 days from now!).</p>
        <p>You pack up your things and prepare enough food for the journey, then take off!</p>
        <p>Launch goes smoothly and you sit back, put on your headphones, and prepare for a relaxing trip.</p>
        <p>A week later, things are going great. There's nothing for you to do except read, listen to music, and watch movies. Just then, you hear a strange sound.</p>
        <p>"meow."</p>
        <p>It sounds like Gizmo, your cat! She must have snuck aboard while you were packing!</p>
        <p>You're happy to have the company, but you didn't pack enough food for the both of you, and there certainly isn't a grocery store on the way to Mars.</p>
        <p>You have a choice: risk running out of food on the return trip, or turn around now and go home. What will you do?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer12">
        <p>You decide to stay home. They'll get someone else to fly to Mars. Besides, you heard that they're going to have free pizza at the Space Scouts meeting!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="err1">
        <p>Please answer Mars or Earth.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer21">
        <p>After a couple of days on your trip back home. You soon realise that you and Gizmo have gobbled up all the sandwiches.</p>
        <p>So this means theres nothing left for you and Gizmo to eat, which is another problem. You also know that sooner or later, the both of you 
            will be starving again.
        </p>
        <p>So a few hours later, your hunger strikes and you have no choice but to view Gizmo as the lovely meal you will have sooner or later.</p>
        <p>You have a choice: risk your life for the next coming days, or decide to grill Gizmo. What will you do?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer22">
        <p>Let someone else get the robot. You turn the Flying Hippo around and head home.</p>
        <p>When you get back to the spaceport, you open the door to exit your spaceship and your boss is standing outside.</p>
        <p>You apologize and explain the whole thing to him about how there wouldn't have been enough food.</p>
        <p>Steam comes out of your boss's mechanical head as he tells you that there are always plenty of sandwiches on Mars, and that you would have been just fine if you had completed your mission. He fires you. You pick up Gizmo and start walking home.</p>
        <p>Oh well, at least you still have Gizmo!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="err2">
        <p>Please answer Risk It or Go Home.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="storyPart" id="answer31">
       <p>OK! Now that you are risking your life for your lovely cat.</p>
       <p>It's only a few days left for you to land on earth. Luckily, your body's durability can withstand hunger for the next few days.</p>
       <p>There are plenty of meals you can order as soon as you land on Earth.</p>
       <p>Now this is another mission. One of the two restaurants near the space station, Domino's Pizza and McDonald's, have a treasure box stored just for you.</p>
       <p>Yes!! A treasure box.</p>
       <p>So you will have to pick the correct restaurant to feed your hunger and luckily you can receive your treasure box.</p>
       <p>But you only get to pick one restaurant between the two.</p>
       <p>So you have a choice: will you pick Domino's or McDonald's?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer32">
        <p>Too Bad!! you have ate unhealthy meat which is detrimental for your body.</p>
        <p>So you end up losing your life including Gizmo.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="storyPart" id="err3">
        <p>Please answer Risk my life or Grill Gizmo</p>
    </div>

    <div class="storyPart" id="answer41">
        <p><strong>Congratulations!!!</strong>You have found the treasure box.</p>
        <p>You are the only person who will know what is inside the box and you will also get your chance to open it whenever you want.</p>
        <p>It is yours, all yours!!!</p>
        <p>IMPRESSIVE WORK, CAPTAIN!!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="storyPart" id="answer42">
        <p>OOPS!!</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, you have picked the restaurant without the treasure.</p>
        <p>But for your impressive work, you will be getting free meals at McDonald's.</p>
        <p>The whole station highly appreciates your work, Captain.</p>
